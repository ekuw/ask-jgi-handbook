# Shift sign-up

Shifts are booked using the Ask-JGI calendar
[here](https://outlook.office.com/calendar/ask-jgi@bristol.ac.uk/view/month).


```{note}
You will need to be signed in to Outlook to access the above calendar.
```

## Booking shifts

Open shift blocks are pre-entered in the Ask-JGI Outlook
calendar. There are two shift blocks (**Shift 1** and
**Shift 2**), with a one week overlap between blocks. 
These shifts appear in the Outlook calendar as recurring
events (repeating every two weeks). 

An unbooked shift block will be entered in the calendar as **Shift 1:
Open** or **Shift 2: Open**, and will appear as shown below:

To book an available shift block:
1. Click the block that you want to
book in the Outlook calendar and select "Edit". From the drop down
menu, select the option to edit **This event**.
```{important}
It's important that you edit only one occurence of the event and not
the series. Make sure you select **This event** from the "Edit"
options.
```

2. Change the event title from **Shift 1: Open** or **Shift 2:: Open**
to your name (the shift is being booked by Bob in the example
below). </br></br>
3. Set the event to show as **Busy**, as shown in the example below.

</br></br>
4. Double check that you have entered your name and that the event is
   set to show as **Busy**. When satisfied, save your changes as shown below.
```{danger}
Please make absolutely sure that you are editing a **single
occurrence** of a repeating series,
rather than the entire series, before you hit save! 

This should be confirmed in the information banner at the top of the
event window, just below the save button, as shown below.
```
