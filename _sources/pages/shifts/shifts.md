# Data science shifts

The postgraduate team working on Ask-JGI are expected to work
collaboratively to manage the Ask-JGI mailbox. This activity has been
designed to allow ad-hoc working, so that queries can be picked up
within the constraints of Ask-JGI student PhD studies and other
work/university commitments. For this reason, all members of the
Ask-JGI student team will be expected to be present at [Weekly
meetings](meetings), and to routinely monitor the Ask-JGI Slack channel when possible. 

To make sure that there is always at least one team member checking
the Ask-JGI mailbox a throughout the day, Ask-JGI students are
required to sign up for so-called **data science shifts**.

More information on these data science shifts can be found in the
upcoming sections of this book, or directly through the following links:
