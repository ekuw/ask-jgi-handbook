# Contract and working hours

```{important}
Please note the university [guidance](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/finances/advice/part-time-work/) on working part time during your
studies. Ph.D. students contributing to the Ask-JGI team must have the
approval of their supervisors, and should agree an upper limit on the
number of hours they should be dedicating to Ask-JGI each month.
```

Most Ask-JGI student contracts are handled by the University of
Bristol's [**T**emporary **S**taffing **S**ervice
(TSS)](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/temporary-staffing/). 
This is the case for candidates who meet the following criteria:
- Will be based in the UK for the duration of the contract.
- Do not hold any other employment contracts at the University of
  Bristol.
  
Assuming the above criteria are fulfilled, a [Casual,
Academic and Guest Candidate Request Form (CAG CRF)](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/temporary-staffing/cag/forms-and-guidance/) will need to be
downloaded and completed by the candidate and the Ask-JGI manager. The form must
be sent to TSS at tss-cag@bristol.ac.uk **at least 3 weeks** prior to
the commencement of Ask-JGI activities.


To claim payment each month, students will need to send a completed
time sheet to the JGI Manager, who will enter their hours on MyERP.


There are some cases where the above criteria do not apply (see below subsections).

#### Student already employed through UoB HR

In cases where a student is already a staff member at the University,
a payment route has already been set up through HR. This means that
hours worked on Ask-JGI must be claimed by the student through MyERP
using a **Staff Fee Claim** form.

The student will require a budget code and hourly rate (excluding
holiday pay as annual leave benefits are already included as part of
their main contract) from the Ask-JGI manager.

#### Student based internationally

In cases where a student is going to be based overseas for part or the
duration of their contract a special exception should be sought
through the [International Mobility
Office](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/hr/policies/international-mobility/). 
Provided that the International Mobility team are able to approve the
circumstances a TSS contract ought to be able to be drawn up for a
duration of 6 months (maximum for overseas-based workers).
