# Communications and Access

New Ask-JGI team members will require the following:
- Ask-JGI Slack channel [access](slack_access).
- Ask-JGI mailbox [access](mailbox_access)
- Ask-JGI tracker [access](filler)
- Ask-JGI Weekly Meeting agenda [access](indico_access)


(slack_access)=
## Managing access on Slack

All new students should register for the Bristol Data Science Slack
Workspace. They will then need to be added to the ask-jgi channel.

(mailbox_access)=
## Mailbox access

All new students will need access to the Ask-JGI mailbox. 

Access to shared mailboxes can be managed via the IT Services [shared
mailboxes admin tool](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/it-services/applications/shared-mailboxes/sharedmailboxes)
as described in these [instructions for requesting and managing shared mailboxes](https://uob.sharepoint.com/sites/systemsupport/SitePages/online-shared-mailbox-admin.aspx).


(tracker_access)=
## Tracker access

In order to gain access to the Ask-JGI tracker, new students will need
to be added to the group `grp-Jean Golding Institute AskJGI PhD
Students`. 

Access is managed
[here](https://uob.sharepoint.com/teams/grp-jeangoldinginstituteteam/_layouts/15/people.aspx?MembershipGroupId=1001),
and any existing JGI team member should be able to add a new member to
this group.


(indico_access)=
## Managing access on indico

Ask-JGI weekly meeting agendas are hosted on [indico](https://indico.cern.ch/). 
Information about the JGI indico setup can be found [here](indico).

When a new member joins the Ask-JGI team, one of the JGI indico
managers will need to add the new member's indico account to the
access list for the `Group Meetings` [indico
category](https://indico.cern.ch/category/14729/). This can be done by
someone with manage access to the JGI indico. 

Follow the instructions below to add a new member to
the `Group Meetings` indico category:

1.  Navigate to the Jean Golding Institute Group Meetings [indico
   category](https://indico.cern.ch/category/14729/) and select the
   `Manage category` icon, as shown in the image below. This will
   direct you to the management area of the `Group Meetings` indico category.

    </br></br>
2.  Once you have switched to the management area, select `Protection`
   on the left hand navigation menu. This will take you to the
   category protection settings. You will be able to see the list of
   users who currently have access (the usernames and emails are
   redacted in the image below). Select the option to add a user by
   clicking the `User` icon at the
   bottom of the list of existing users.

    </br></br>
3.  Selecting the add user option will open a window like that shown
    in the image below. Here you should be able to search for the
    member that you want to grant access to. Note that the user will
    need to have already registered for an indico account in order for
    this to work.

4.  Don't forget to save your changes. You should then be able to see
    the new member listed in the access list, and they should be able
    to access the group meeting agendas when they are signed in to indico.
