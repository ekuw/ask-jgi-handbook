  with the team.
- The Ask-JGI team members on shift that week will provide an update
  on any new or ongoing queries in the mailbox that they are dealing
  with.
- Any Ask-JGI team member can ask for help, advice, or guidance on a query that
  they are dealing with or a project that they are working on.
- Any Ask-JGI team member can present an update on an Ask-JGI related
  piece of work.
- There will be a round-table opportunity at the end of the meeting
  for everyone to bring up any questions, queries, updates or concerns
  that they have.
