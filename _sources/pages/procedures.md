# How it works

This page outlines how Ask-JGI works in the following segments:
- [The life-cycle of a query](query)
- [Ask-JGI reporting and documentation](report)

(query)=
## Ask-JGI queries
1. Researchers email their queries to ask-jgi@bristol.ac.uk
 <br/><br/>
2. An automatic email is sent to the querier, asking for additional
  details (e.g. description of aim and problem, description or excerpt
  of data) and letting them know to expect a response within the next
  few days.
   <br/><br/>
3. The Ask-JGI shift-coordinator will share the queries in the Ask-JGI
  **slack channel** and those on shift will come forward to reply to the
  query.
   <br/><br/>
4. Once it has been agreed who will pick up the query,
  that team member is responsible for assigning the task to themselves
  on the [](tracker), and recording information on the school and
  faculty of the querier, and allocating relevant tags. Instructions
  on how to fill out tickets on the Ask-JGI tracker can be found
  [here](tracker). 
   <br/><br/>
5. The Ask-JGI team member responsible for the query will respond to
  the querier to either answer their question or to arrange a meeting
  to discuss further. **It is important to reply to the latest email
  in the email thread (which includes the Ask-JGI automatic response)
  so that the Ask-JGI ticket number is included in the continuing
  email thread**. This ensures that the same tracker ticket is updated
  as the email thread evolves. For more information on this, see
  [here](ticket_numbers).
   <br/><br/>
6. The Ask-JGI team member should use the notes section of their query
  ticket on the Ask-JGI tracker to record the status and current
  actions from their query. 
   <br/><br/>
7. Once the query has been resolved the ticket on the tracker should be
  marked as resolved.

## Reporting
Although Ask-JGI team members have up to one day to spend on Ask-JGI
queries, it is expected that most queries should take half a day or
less. If you have a query that you think might take longer then this
can be discussed with the Ask-JGI shift coordinator. Remember that the
Ask-JGI slack channel is there for you to ask for help and to discuss
your queries. 

Shifters are responsible for recording honestly the time that is spent
on each Ask-JGI query. This time can include time spent preparing for
and participating in meetings with Ask-JGI "customers," as well as any
time spent researching the query and preparing email responses. 

Once a query has been resolved the Ask-JGI team member should note the
number of hours spent on the query on the tracker ticket.
