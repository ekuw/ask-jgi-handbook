# Ask-JGI tracker

In order to track the progress of individual Ask-JGI queries, and to
gather information for reporting purposes, new emails received in the
Ask-JGI mailbox automatically generate a ticket on the so-called
Ask-JGI tracker, which can be found
[here](https://uob.sharepoint.com/teams/grp-jeangoldinginstituteteam/Lists/AskJGI%20tracker/Open%20Items.aspx).

See below for more information on the following:

## Automatic ticket updates

When a new email is received in the Ask-JGI mailbox an automated
response is generated, which looks something like:
```
Thank you for your Ask-JGI enquiry. It has been received by our team
and you should receive a response within 5 working days. 

Please feel free to reply to this email if you want to provide any
supplementary information to your question. Just make sure you either
reply directly to this email, or else include the phrase somewhere in 
the email: {AskJGI-110}. This helps us to track how the AskJGI service 
is used.

Suggested additional information:
 1. Your research question
 2. Any relevant papers / draft manuscripts etc.
 3. A description of your data (and a sample if you can send it)
 4. Any relevant analysis scripts/code that you have produced so far.

If you need a reply more urgently then please reply to this email and
we will aim to get back to you sooner.
```
Note the {AskJGI-110} in the text above. The number corresponds to
the Ask-JGI ticket number (110 in this example), which increments with each newly received
query. This number acts as a unique identifier for the email thread,
which is then used to open a new ticket in the Ask-JGI tracker. All
subsequent emails that contain this same identifier will be associated
with the newly created ticket (so that the ticket gets updated with
each new email in the thread).

## Filling out the tracker

When a new Ask-JGI query is received and an automatic reply is sent,
a new ticket is opened on the Ask-JGI tracker. This will look
something like the entry below:
:::{image} ../images/tracker_screenshot.png
:::
</br></br>
Some of the information is automatically filled out, as shown in the
image above. The **Who** field is updated with the email address of
the query sender, the **Query** field is filled with the email title,
and the date of the query (**Date opened**) and the last time the
query was updated (**Date updated** -- the
date of the latest email in the thread associated with that query) are
set. 

1.  Open the ticket by clicking on the title under the **Query** field
   heading. You will see the automatically set **Who**, **Query**, and
   dates fields:

:::
</br></br>
2.  If the title of the email is obscure or could be made more concise,
change the **Query** field to something more meaningful and easy to
understand.</br>
3.  The **Status** field is automatically set to "New" for newly
	opened tickets. Once you have started work on your query, this
	status should be changed to "In progress."

:::
</br></br>
4. The **Notes** field should be used to make any notes/supplementary
   details on the status of the query. 
:::{image} ../images/ticket_notes.png
:::
</br></br>
5. Add your name / email address under the **Assigned to**
field. There is also an **Assigned to 2** field. This can be used
e.g. if you are working jointly on a query with another team
member. Otherwise it can be left blank.

:::
</br></br>
6. Select the Faculty that the person who submitted the query is
associated with. This may require some Google searching if the
information is not included in their email. Note that there is a drop
down list for this, but new options can be added as free text. Please
take care not to duplicate entries (e.g. _Science_ and _science_ would
show up as different faculties and this is inconvenient for analytics
and reporting later on).

</br></br>
7. Select the School that the person who submitted the query is
associated with. Note that there is the option to select "External"
for contacts from outside the University of Bristol.

:::
</br></br>
8. Select all tags that apply from the drop-down list under the
   **Tags** field.

:::
</br></br>
9. Record the number of hours spent on a given task in the **Time
   Allocation** field. This includes time taken to respond to emails,
   setting up and attending meetings with service users, and
   investigating the question itself (be it reviewing code,
   data, research, etc.). If you think a query is going to take more
   than 5 hours of your time, discuss this with your data science
   supervisor.
