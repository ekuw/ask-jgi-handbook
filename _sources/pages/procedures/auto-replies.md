# Automatic email replies

When a new email is received in the Ask-JGI mailbox an automated
response is generated, which looks something like:

```
Thank you for your Ask-JGI enquiry. Your query will be picked up by a member of the Ask-JGI team soon.

In the meantime please reply to this email to provide any
supplementary information to your question. 
Make sure you include this phrase somewhere in the email:
{AskJGI-110}. 
This helps us to track how the AskJGI service is used.

Suggested additional information:
 1. Your research question
 2. Any relevant papers / draft manuscripts etc.
 3. A description of your data (and a sample if you can send it)
 4. Any relevant analysis scripts/code that you have produced so far.

```
It is important that, when you respond to the initial query, you
either:
- "reply all" to this automated reply from Ask-JGI, or
- include the requested text (`{AskJGI-110}` in the example above) in
  the signature of your response.
  
This helps us to manage our query tracking system, as explained in our
section describing the [Ask-JGI tracker](tracker) [here](ticket_numbers).
