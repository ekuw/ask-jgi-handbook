# Automatic ticket updates

When a new email is received in the Ask-JGI mailbox an automated
response is generated, which looks something like:
```
Thank you for your Ask-JGI enquiry. Your query will be picked up by a member of the Ask-JGI team soon.

In the meantime please reply to this email to provide any
supplementary information to your question. 
Make sure you include this phrase somewhere in the email:
{AskJGI-110}. 
This helps us to track how the AskJGI service is used.

Suggested additional information:
 1. Your research question
 2. Any relevant papers / draft manuscripts etc.
 3. A description of your data (and a sample if you can send it)
 4. Any relevant analysis scripts/code that you have produced so far.

```
Note the {AskJGI-110} in the text above. The number corresponds to
the Ask-JGI ticket number (110 in this example), which increments with each newly received
query. This number acts as a unique identifier for the email thread,
which is then used to open a new ticket in the Ask-JGI tracker. All
subsequent emails that contain this same identifier will be associated
with the newly created ticket (so that the ticket gets updated with
each new email in the thread).  

## Duplicate tickets

As noted above, when responding to a query it is important to reply to the latest email in the email thread (which includes the Ask-JGI automatic response) so that the Ask-JGI ticket number is included in the continuing email thread. This ensures that the same tracker ticket is updated as the email thread evolves.

```{warning}
The Ask-JGI tracker system will get messy if the Ask-JGI ticket number
is not included in **all** emails in the thread.
```

The system breaks down if:
- You reply directly to the query email instead of the auto-response and forget to manually include the tracking number in your reply.
- The person who submitted the query removes the tracking number from
  the email thread (e.g. by trimming your email from the thread in
  their reply, thereby removing the tracking number).
  

The consequences of the system breaking down are as follows:
- The person who submitted the query will get a new auto-response email generated each time they email the inbox (with a new tracking number).
- There will be a new ticket logged in the tracker each time a new auto-response is generated by the querier.


### Resolving duplicate tickets

When tickets on the tracker are duplicated, follow these steps:

- The next time you compose a reply to the querier, remove any trace of the “new” tracking numbers from repeated auto-responses from the email thread.

- Include the original tracking ID in your reply.

- Point out in your reply what has happened to acknowledge the
  repeated auto-replies and remind them to include the tracking number
  in subsequent emails:
  ```
  As a reminder, please try to make sure you include this phrase
  somewhere in subsequent emails in this thread: {AskJGI-XXX}. This
  helps us to track how the AskJGI service is used and will suppress
  repeated automatic responses.
  ```
