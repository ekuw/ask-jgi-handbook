# Arranging meetings

It is common to receive queries in the mailbox that require a short
meeting with the querier in order to clarify their question, their
needs, and their expectations. The Ask-JGI student who has been
assigned a query is responsible for setting up this meeting. 

Please see instructions below on the following:
- [How to set up meetings](meeting-setup)
- [Following up after a meeting](meeting-followup)

## How to set up meetings

If meeting with the querier seems to be the most productive next
step, reply to their email (including the tracking identification
number) and suggest some times that you are able to meet. 

- If you use
  your university Outlook calendar, you can either suggest that they
  book a meeting directly into your calendar at a time convenient for
  them. For example:
  ```
  Dear XXX, 
  
  Many thanks for geting in contact with Ask-JGI. Would it be useful
  to have an introductory Teams call (30 minutes, say) to go over your
  query in a little more detail and see how we might be able to
  support? 
  I can also explain how we might go about assisting and work out
  which of our team would be best placed to help you.
  
  I’ve cc’d my email address into this email – if you can get access to
  my calendar then I’m happy for you to schedule something at a time that
  suits you.
  
  Kind regards,
  XXX
  {AskJGI-XXX}
  ```

- or, you can ask permission to book a meeting in their calendar at
  a time where their calendar shows them as being free.
  For example:
  ```
  Dear XXX, 
  
  Many thanks for geting in contact with Ask-JGI. Would it be useful
  to have an introductory Teams call (30 minutes, say) to go over your
  query in a little more detail and see how we might be able to
  support? 
  I can also explain how we might go about assisting and work out
  which of our team would be best placed to help you.
  
  If you'd like me to set up a meeting then please let me know. I
  could do tomorrow afternoon or the following morning, for example?
  Alternatively I can try to find a slot in your calendar if it is up
  to date? 
  
  Kind regards,
  XXX
  {AskJGI-XXX}
  ```

## Following up after a meeting

Once you have had a consultation meeting with a querier you should begin to compose a
summary email to them as soon as possible. Doing this sooner rather
than later helps to ensure that everything is fresh in your mind,
making it less likely that you will forget something. Use any notes
that you have taken during your meeting to help you.

Sending summary emails are important:
- It is helpful to repeat your key takeaways from the meetings to make
sure that everyone attending the meeting has left on the same page.
- Having a written record from the meeting is helpful for any future
  follow-up with querier (particularly if the followup is handled by
  another team member).
  
When composing your summary emails try to include the following:
- restate the purpose of the meeting, the key questions that the
  querier needed help with.
- if there was some level of ongoing support or action agreed, make
  clear in this email at what level that the JGI will be able to
  support this.
- sometimes these meetings help to clarify exactly what the querier is
  asking, and there might be several questions mixed up in
  there. Break the query down into its constituent parts in the email.
- review what you discussed, using subject headings if appropriate to
  separate the different aspects of the problem.
- link to any resources that you discussed during the meeting, or that
  you think might be relevant.
- finish the email by stating the next steps, e.g.:
  - perhaps you agreed that the querier will take away this
    information and get back to Ask-JGI if they have any follow up
    questions.
  - perhaps you agreed that the querier will send you some data to
    look at, or perhaps you already have the data.
  - if there is further action already anticipated, from either you or
    the querier, include a timeline for when the next contact is
    expected.

If in any doubt, ask for help! The Ask-JGI coordinator and JGI Data
Scientists will be happy to review any email before you send it.

```{note}
Remember to update the Ask-JGI tracker after a meeting to reflect what has
happened and what is expected to happen next (if any followup is expected). Update the status field to indicate whether the query is
resolved or still in progress.
