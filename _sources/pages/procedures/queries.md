# Ask-JGI queries
1. Researchers email their queries to ask-jgi@bristol.ac.uk
 <br/><br/>
2. An [automatic email](auto-replies) is sent to the querier, as explained [here](auto-replies). This
  email asks the querier for additional
  details (e.g. description of aim and problem, description or excerpt
  of data) and letting them know to expect a response within the next
  few days. 
   <br/><br/>
3. The Ask-JGI student on shift will share the query in the Ask-JGI
  **slack channel**, and will either:
  - confirm that they intend to reply to the query, or
  - ask whether anyone else is available to do so.
  Noting the new query in the Slack channel gives those not on shift
  the opportunity to collaborate on the query if it is of interest to
  them, or falls within their own area of expertise. Likewise, the
  person on shift may not feel that they have the
  appropriate level of expertise in the relevant area. If this is the
  case it is also possible to ask for advice from the rest of the team
  on how to proceed, or to request support to answer the query.
   <br/><br/>
4. Once it has been agreed who will pick up the query,
  that team member is responsible for assigning the task to themselves
  on the [](tracker), and recording information on the school and
  faculty of the querier, and allocating relevant tags. Instructions
  on how to fill out tickets on the Ask-JGI tracker can be found
  [here](tracker). 
   <br/><br/>
5. The Ask-JGI team member responsible for the query will respond to
  the querier to either answer their question or to [arrange a meeting](arranging-meetings)
  to discuss further. **It is important to reply to the latest email
  in the email thread (which includes the Ask-JGI automatic response)
  so that the Ask-JGI ticket number is included in the continuing
  email thread**. This ensures that the same tracker ticket is updated
  as the email thread evolves. For more information on this, see
  [here](ticket_numbers).
   <br/><br/>
6. The Ask-JGI team member should use the notes section of their query
  ticket on the Ask-JGI tracker to record the status and current
  actions from their query. 
   <br/><br/>
7. Once the query has been resolved the ticket on the tracker should be
  marked as resolved.
