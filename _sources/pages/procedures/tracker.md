# Ask-JGI tracker

In order to track the progress of individual Ask-JGI queries, and to
gather information for reporting purposes, new emails received in the
Ask-JGI mailbox automatically generate a ticket on the so-called
Ask-JGI tracker, which can be found
[here](https://uob.sharepoint.com/teams/grp-jeangoldinginstituteteam/Lists/AskJGI%20tracker/Open%20Items.aspx).

See below for more information on the following:
