## Filling out the tracker

This section outlines the procedure that should be followed any time
a new Ask-JGI query is received, and when any further action is taken
thereafter. This other action could be a response to the query, a
follow up email from the querier, or following up from a meeting.

When a new Ask-JGI query is received and an automatic reply is sent,
a new ticket is opened on the Ask-JGI tracker. This will look
something like the entry below:

</br></br>
Some of the information is automatically filled out, as shown in the
image above. The **Who** field is updated with the email address of
the query sender, the **Query** field is filled with the email title,
and the date of the query (**Date opened**) and the last time the
query was updated (**Date updated** -- the
date of the latest email in the thread associated with that query) are
set. 

1.  Open the ticket by clicking on the title under the **Query** field
   heading. You will see the automatically set **Who**, **Query**, and
   dates fields:

2.  If the title of the email is obscure or could be made more concise,
change the **Query** field to something more meaningful and easy to
understand.</br>
3.  The **Status** field is automatically set to "New" for newly
	opened tickets. Once you have started work on your query, this
	status should be changed to "In progress."

4. The **Notes** field should be used to make any notes/supplementary
   details on the status of the query.

5. Add your name / email address under the **Assigned to**
field. There is also an **Assigned to 2** field. This can be used
e.g. if you are working jointly on a query with another team
member. Otherwise it can be left blank.

6. Select the Faculty that the person who submitted the query is
associated with. This may require some Google searching if the
information is not included in their email. Note that there is a drop
down list for this, but new options can be added as free text. Please
take care not to duplicate entries (e.g. _Science_ and _science_ would
show up as different faculties and this is inconvenient for analytics
and reporting later on).

7. Select the School that the person who submitted the query is
associated with. Note that there is the option to select "External"
for contacts from outside the University of Bristol.

8. Select all tags that apply from the drop-down list under the
   **Tags** field.

9. Record the number of hours spent on a given task in the **Time
   Allocation** field. This includes time taken to respond to emails,
   setting up and attending meetings with service users, and
   investigating the question itself (be it reviewing code,
   data, research, etc.). If you think a query is going to take more
   than 5 hours of your time, discuss this with your data science
   supervisor.
