# Getting started

If you are a new recruit looking to get set up for working with
Ask-JGI, welcome to the team! 

This handbook is meant to serve as a guide to explain how Ask-JGI
works and what is expected of you as an Ask-JGI shifter. Please take
the time to read through the procedures chapter in this handbook to
make sure that you are up to speed on your responsibilities.

Before you begin your first Ask-JGI shift you will need to make sure
that you are able to access some platforms, pages and groups. Please
see the sections below for instructions on how to get yourself ready
for your first shift. 

## Communicating on Slack

The platform that the Ask-JGI team uses to stay in touch on a
day-to-day basis is Slack. The Jean Golding Institute hosts a Slack
workspace called **Bristol Data Science Network**, where we aim to
stay in touch with our community, and share ideas, events and
opportunities with researchers, stakeholders and industry
professionals. 

Sign up to join the **Bristol Data Science Network** Slack Workspace
[here](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/golding/get-involved/build-your-network/slack/).

Once you have signed in you should ask the Ask-JGI coordinator to add
you to the private ask-jgi channel, which is the channel that the team
uses to communicate about all things Ask-JGI.

## Getting set up with indico

While working with Ask-JGI you will be expected to
attend weekly catch up meetings with the rest of the team. 

The Ask-JGI weekly meetings are managed through
[indico](https://indico.cern.ch/). You will need to set up an account
to be able to access Ask-JGI meeting agendas online. Please find
information about indico [here](indico), and instructions on
registering for an account [here](account).

## Ask-JGI mailbox access

A major part of your duties while undertaking shifts for Ask-JGI will
be to monitor the Ask-JGI mailbox. 

Before beginning your first shift
you must make sure that you are able to access the mailbox
[here](https://outlook.office.com/mail/ask-jgi@bristol.ac.uk/inbox).
Contact the Ask-JGI coordinator in case of problems and they should be
able to grant you access.

## Ask-JGI tracker access

Any new query that is submitted to Ask-JGI results in a ticket being
opened on the [Ask-JGI tracker](filler).

Before beginning your first shift
you must make sure that you are able to access the tracker
[here](https://uob.sharepoint.com/teams/grp-jeangoldinginstituteteam/Lists/AskJGI%20tracker).
Contact the Ask-JGI coordinator in case of problems and they should be
able to grant you access.
